## Overview

Serenity Now is a calming, mobile-first meditation app that provides a curated selection of 10-minute sessions. Each session pairs immersive background videos with soft ambient soundtracks, helping users unwind through a clean and focused interface. The app is optimized for accessibility and responsive performance across all devices.

### The challenge

Building an app that combines HTML5 video, audio, and JavaScript timers in a seamless way â€” all while maintaining performance, responsiveness, and accessibility. Ensuring media loaded efficiently and that users could easily control their experience (start, pause, reset, switch durations) across multiple themed pages was key.

## My process

1. **Conceptualization**: Inspired by JavaScript clock and timer tutorials, I reimagined the concept into a mood-focused meditation app with a tranquil, aesthetic-first approach.

2. **Design and Styling**: I created a clean and visually pleasing design, incorporating a responsive layout to ensure an optimal experience on mobile devices. This project served as an opportunity to use a pure css image I made for the intro screen.

3. **Frontend Development**: Implemented the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Integrated the Swiper library for the playlist carousel and designed custom controls for video and audio playback.

4. **Audio Integration**: Utilized the HTML5 `<audio>` element to seamlessly integrate background music with play, pause, and reset controls.

5. **Testing**: Conducted extensive testing across various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and performance. Made adjustments to enhance the user experience.
